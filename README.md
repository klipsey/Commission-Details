Current commission queue 3/4

These commissions are for a limited time only and will begin in June. The queue may vary depending on the complexity of commissions but as of now, I am predicting a maximum of 4-6 regular complexity survivors can be commissioned. During this time period, my planned survivors outside of commissions will be developed but with less priority.

## Commission Costs
Costs can increase or decrease heavily based on multiple factors 

Note: Having previous assets for me to use will lower the price for the section involved. This does not apply for all sections

EX: Model lowers price by 90$ - 120$

## NOTES

I am only familiar with creating characters with the Risk of Rain style. I cannot take commissions for characters that do not fit within that scope because I do not want to give you a sub-par product for my pricing.

Please avoid requesting a character with no concept art or drafted abilities, I’m not a concept artist and the character is your idea. It's ok if the concepts are simple but I need something to work with. Mood boards do not count.

Payment is half upfront, half before files are given.

If you would like your mod to be maintained by me, you must be willing to make it a public mod. This means that it must be posted to thunderstore and not shared through local files. This does not require it to be public on github.

If you would like it to be maintained in the case that I no longer mod, giving permission for me to make the character public on github can help guarantee that.

It’s ok if you commission parts from me and parts from other developers. As stated at the start though, if anything made from other developers actively impedes my ability to finish your commission, it will be disregarded.

NO NSFW MODS
